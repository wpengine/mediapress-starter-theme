=== MediaPress Starter Theme ===

This theme is intended to demonstrate how some MediaPress features work.

MediaPress Live - Select the "template-live" post template to include Live Feed, Timeline and Flag blocks on a post.

MediaPress Listicles - Select the "template-listicle-post" post template to include Listicle Navigation block below the main site header, which will automatically display correct navigation links based on the content of a listicle block within post content.

MediaPress Blocks - Select the "template-full" post template to display full-width post content alongside a basic header and footer. This can be used with Full Site Editing (FSE) and MediaPress Blocks to provide more freedom for users looking to create rich, interactive design-led posts directly within the Block Editor.
